Hello all,
I have recently started my learning journey towards completing Javascript. I have started learning through youtube tutorials and have started from the absolute basics.
I will slowly increase the level of my learning and progressively move towards achieving my end goal of being fluent in Js.
I am using github as a documenting platform so that later I can look back on what I have done.
Feel free to go through the different files and commits.
Thanks,
~port
