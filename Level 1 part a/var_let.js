console.log("Lets talk about var and let and constant")
// var is globally scoped and let and const are block scoped 

var a=45
let b=52

// var can be updated and redeclared within the scope
// let can be updated but not redeclared
// const can neither be updated or redeclared
// var variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and const are not initialezed so u have to give it a value when u initialze them
